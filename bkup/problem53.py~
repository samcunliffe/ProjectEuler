# Project Euler Problem 53
# ========================
#  
# There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from
# five, 12345:
#
# 123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345
#   
# In combinatorics, we use the notation, 5C3 = 10.
#  
# In general,
#         nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!
# 
# where r <= n, n! = nx(n-1)x...x3x2x1, and 0! = 1.
# 
# It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds
# one-million: 23C10 = 1144066.
# 
# How many, not necessarily distinct, values of
# nCr, for 1 <= n <= 100, are greater than
# one-million?
