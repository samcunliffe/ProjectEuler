====================

Hello [haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) Î».
I'm trying to teach myself haskell (basically, I'm following [lyah](http://learnyouahaskell.com)).
Here are my haskell solutions to PE.

I don't really know who reads other people's code, but if you are a haskell expert and have some tips please do comment.
