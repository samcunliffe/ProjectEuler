My Project Euler Solutions
==========================

My solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems.
I've solved a fair few in python and octave.
Now I'm redoing them all in haskell in an effort to learn haskell.
I used to be [greeneggs](https://projecteuler.net/profile/greeneggs.png) but I forgot that password :-( so my haskell attempts will be [green0eggs](https://projecteuler.net/profile/green0eggs.png)

Using python and [octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/):

Using haskell:

Hopefully you're not going to look at my solutions if you haven't solved them yourself, that would kind of miss the point.
